    """Merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF document.

    This function takes a list of paths to PDF files and an output path
    for the merged PDF. It uses the PyPDF2 library to perform the merge.

    Args:
        input_paths (List[Union[str, Path]]): A list of file paths for the PDF
            documents to be merged. Each path can be a string or a Path object.
            Requires at least two PDF files.
        output_path (Union[str, Path]): The file path where the merged PDF
            document will be saved. Can be a string or a Path object.

    Returns:
        Path: The absolute path to the successfully created merged PDF file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If fewer than two input paths are provided, if any input
            file is not a PDF, or if the output path is invalid.
        FileNotFoundError: If any of the input PDF files do not exist.
        PyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError: If an input PDF file is corrupted or
            cannot be read by PyPDF2.
        Exception: For other unexpected errors during the merging process.

    Example:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> # Assume pdf1.pdf, pdf2.pdf exist
        >>> # merged_output.pdf will be created in the current directory
