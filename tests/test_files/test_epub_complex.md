# Chapter 3: Conclusion

This test EPUB file has demonstrated various features that should be 
        properly handled during conversion:

- Multiple chapters with navigation
- Rich HTML formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- CSS styling for consistent appearance
- Tables with headers and data
- Code blocks and inline code
- Quotes and blockquotes
- Ordered and unordered lists

The quality of a converter is measured not just by what it converts, 
            but by how well it preserves the structure and formatting of the original 
            document.

## Final Notes

If all these elements are properly converted, the EPUB converter is working 
        as expected. Any loss of formatting or structure should be documented and 
        addressed.
