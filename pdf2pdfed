**Current Status: Python Backend Complete, GUI Integration Pending**

1.  **Research and Select Python Library:** - ✅ DONE
    *   The web search mentions `OCRmyPDF`, `PyMuPDF` + `EasyOCR`/`pytesseract`, and `AWS Textract`.
    *   `OCRmyPDF` seems like a strong candidate as it's designed to add OCR text layers to PDFs, effectively making them searchable and a common form of "editable." It's open-source and has a Python API.
    *   `PyMuPDF` is already in your environment (as `fitz`) and could be used to manipulate PDFs, potentially in conjunction with an OCR library if `OCRmyPDF` isn't sufficient.
    *   `AWS Textract` is a cloud service, which might not be ideal for a local desktop application unless you plan for cloud integration.
    *   **Decision:** We'll start with `OCRmyPDF` due to its specific focus and Python API.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** - ✅ DONE (for pyproject.toml)
    *   Add `ocrmypdf` to your `pyproject.toml`.
    *   `OCRmyPDF` relies on Tesseract OCR engine. You'll need to ensure Tesseract is installed on the user's system and accessible in the PATH. I'll provide a note about this.
    *   **USER ACTION:** `OCRmyPDF` relies on Tesseract OCR engine. Ensure Tesseract is installed on the user's system and accessible in the PATH. Language packs for Tesseract also need to be installed for desired languages.

3.  **Create New Python Converter Module:** - ✅ DONE
    *   Create a new file: `src/mdtopdf/converters/pdf_to_editable_pdf.py`.
    *   Implement a function, e.g., `convert_pdf_to_editable(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, lang: str = "eng", **kwargs) -> Path`.
        *   This function will use the `ocrmypdf.api.ocr()` method.
        *   It should handle common options like language for OCR (`lang`).
        *   Include error handling and logging.

4.  **Integrate with `electron_bridge.py`:** - ✅ DONE
    *   Define a new `conversion_type`, for example, `"pdf2editable"`.
    *   Add this new type to the `conversion_map` in `electron_bridge.py`, pointing to your new module and function.
        *   Example: `"pdf2editable": ("converters.pdf_to_editable_pdf", None, "convert_pdf_to_editable")`
    *   Update `check_file_extension_compatibility` to ensure the input for `"pdf2editable"` is a `.pdf` file.
    *   Ensure the output path logic in `convert_with_progress` correctly generates a `.pdf` output file for this new type.
    *   Add any relevant command-line arguments to `argparse` in `electron_bridge.py`'s `main` function (e.g., `--lang` for OCR language) and pass them via `converter_options`.

5.  **Update `src/mdtopdf/converters/__init__.py`:** - ✅ DONE
    *   Import and publicly expose the new `convert_pdf_to_editable` function so it can be dynamically imported by the `electron_bridge.py`.

6.  **GUI Integration (Guidance):** - ⏳ PENDING (NEXT MAJOR STEP)
    *   The Electron/React GUI needs updates:
        *   Add "PDF to Editable PDF" option in the UI.
        *   Implement logic to call the Python backend (`electron_bridge.py`) with `conversion_type="pdf2editable"`.
        *   Consider UI elements for OCR options (e.g., language selection).

7.  **Testing:** - ⏳ PENDING
    *   Thorough testing is needed after Python dependencies are installed (run `uv pip sync` or `uv pip install -e .`) AND Tesseract is installed on the system.
    *   Test with various non-editable PDFs.
    *   Verify text selectability and searchability in output PDFs.
    *   Test CLI access via `electron_bridge.py`.
    *   Test through the GUI once integrated.

8.  **Documentation/User Notes:** - ⏳ PENDING
    *   Update any user-facing documentation.
    *   Clarify what "editable PDF" means in this context (searchable/selectable text, not a fully re-flowable document).
    *   Provide clear instructions for Tesseract OCR installation (Windows focus, include PATH and language pack details).
